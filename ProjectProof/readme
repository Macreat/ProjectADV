Air and Environmental Quality Control System Project
This project implements a complete system to monitor and control air quality in a closed environment. The system uses temperature (NTC) and light (LDR) sensors to track environmental parameters, which are displayed on an OLED screen and transmitted via UART for remote monitoring. The project also integrates a matrix keyboard for authentication, as well as LEDs and an actuator control system to indicate states and execute actions according to the sensor levels.

Main Features
Input Sensors:

LDR (Photoresistor): To measure the intensity of ambient light.
NTC (Thermistor): To measure the temperature of the environment.
Visual Indicators:

OLED screen: Shows sensor values ​​and status messages in real time.
LEDs (LD1, LD2, LD3, LD4): Visual indicators according to different temperature and light thresholds.
Actuator Control:

Ventilation motor: Activated or deactivated depending on the temperature threshold.
Light control system: Light intensity control using the LDR sensor.
Matrix Keyboard Authentication: The system requires a valid password to unlock the main functionality, providing a basic level of security.

Communication:

UART: Sensor data is periodically sent via UART for remote monitoring.
Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: STM32 Nucleo-L476RG.
OLED screen: SSD1306.
Sensors: LDR and NTC.
LEDs and motors for indication and control.
Matrix keyboard for authentication.
UART for serial communication.
Functional Implementation

1. Sensors and Monitoring
   The system continuously reads the values ​​from the temperature (NTC) and light (LDR) sensors. Depending on the values ​​obtained, different responses are generated, such as the activation of LEDs or the sending of alerts via UART.

LDR: If the light is too low or high, the system can activate actuators to regulate the environment.

NTC: Three temperature levels are implemented:

< 1700: Safe temperature.
1700 - 3300: Moderate temperature, an additional LED lights up.

> 3300: High temperature, all LEDs activate and a critical warning is sent. 2. Authentication
> The system requires the user to enter a password before unlocking access to control and monitoring sensors. A matrix keyboard is used for password entry. If the password is incorrect, an error message is displayed and you must try again.

3. OLED screen
   The OLED display is used to display current sensor values ​​and status messages. The LDR and NTC values ​​are continuously updated on the screen in real time.

4. UART communication
   Sensor data is continuously transmitted via the UART port so it can be monitored remotely or recorded by another device.

Extended Functionality
Security
This system is highly applicable for security applications, such as fire detection or room or warehouse monitoring. Temperature thresholds can serve as early warnings in the event of hazardous conditions.

Environmental control
The system can be used in greenhouses or other environments where precise control of temperature and light is required. By implementing additional motors and actuators, ventilation and lighting can be controlled automatically.

Crop Automation
The project can be expanded to use more sensors, such as soil moisture, for automated agricultural control. Depending on the sensor values, irrigation and other environmental maintenance systems can be automatically controlled.

Future Modifications and Improvements
Control via Wi-Fi: Integrate an ESP8266 module to add remote system monitoring and control capability through an application or web server.
Improve fan control: Add PWM control to the fan to allow speed adjustments based on sensor values.
Remote Database: The collected data could be stored in a remote database for long-term analysis.
Moisture Control: Add a soil moisture sensor and water pump to automate irrigation in agricultural applications.
Expand the security system: Include more sensors for gas or motion detection, making the system more robust for security applications.
