Air and Environmental Quality Control System Project

This repository is to record the progress made to present the 2024-01 computational structures project

This project implements a complete system to monitor and control air quality in a closed environment. The system uses temperature (NTC) and light (LDR) sensors to track environmental parameters, which are displayed on an OLED screen and transmitted via UART for remote monitoring.
The project also integrates a matrix keyboard for authentication, as well as LEDs and an actuator control system to indicate states and execute actions according to the sensor levels.

The project is delivered completely in the ProjectProof folder and its respective configurations.
