1. General Project Objective:
Your system will monitor and control temperature and light levels in a closed environment using an NTC thermistor and an LDR (light-dependent resistor). The ESP01 module will allow remote monitoring and control through the internet. The OLED SSD1306 will display real-time system information, such as temperature, light levels, and the status of the system.

2. Revised Functional Requirements:
A. Sensor Monitoring (NTC and LDR):
NTC Thermistor for Temperature:

Use an NTC sensor to measure the ambient temperature.
Display temperature on the OLED screen.
Send the temperature reading to the remote system using the ESP01 for remote monitoring.
LDR for Light Sensing:

The LDR will measure the light intensity in the room.
Display the light levels on the OLED screen and send this data via the ESP01.
B. Actuator Control:
Fan Control Based on Temperature:
If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the fan will automatically turn on.
The fan will turn off when the temperature drops below the set threshold.
Lights Control Based on Light Intensity:
When the light level is below a certain threshold, turn on additional lights (if applicable) or take action such as closing a mechanical grid.
C. Remote Monitoring & Control (ESP01):
Wi-Fi Connectivity with ESP01:

Implement a network communication system using the ESP01 module. This will allow remote access via the internet.
Through this remote system, users can view sensor data (temperature and light intensity) and manually control the fan and light system.
Command via Web Interface:

Create a simple interface for sending commands to the STM32 (like turning on/off the fan or lights).
The system will react within 1 second to commands sent remotely.
D. OLED SSD1306 Display:
Real-time Monitoring Display:
Display the current temperature and light levels on the OLED.
Display the status of the fan (on/off), light control system, and connection to the internet.
3. Revised Non-Functional Requirements:
Response Time:

The system should react to remote commands (via ESP01) within 1 second.
Modular Code Design:

The code should be modular with separate libraries for the NTC temperature sensor, LDR, OLED display, ESP01, and control logic.
This will make it easier to maintain and modify.
Security:

Implement a basic authentication system for remote access, like a simple password check over the ESP01 network interface, to prevent unauthorized control.
4. Implementation Overview:
A. Temperature & Light Sensors:
NTC Thermistor Setup:

Configure an ADC channel to read the voltage from the NTC sensor.
Use a voltage divider circuit with the NTC and a resistor to measure temperature.
Implement the Steinhart-Hart equation or a simplified version to convert resistance to temperature in Celsius.
LDR Setup:

Configure a second ADC channel to read the voltage from the LDR.
Use a voltage divider to measure the light intensity, with adjustments to map the analog reading to light levels.
B. OLED SSD1306 Display:
Use the SSD1306 driver to display real-time values:
Line 1: Temperature
Line 2: Light Intensity
Line 3: Fan Status
Line 4: ESP01 Connection Status
C. Fan and Light Control:
Temperature-based Fan Control Logic:

If temperature > threshold, turn on the fan. If temperature < threshold, turn it off.
Light-based Control Logic:

If light intensity < threshold, trigger an action (e.g., adjust mechanical grid or notify via the ESP01).
D. ESP01 Network Interface:
Connect ESP01:
Use UART to communicate with the ESP01 module. Implement commands for:
Querying the current temperature and light levels.
Manually toggling the fan or other control systems.
Remote Commands:
Configure ESP01 to receive commands from a web interface and control the STM32 system accordingly.
Real-time Data:
Periodically send the sensor data (temperature and light) to the web interface for monitoring.
